La Compagnie des Tiers-Lieux is organizing two days (5-6 november 2020) dedicated to setup and take ownership on software tools adapted to a third place's activity. In particular we will propose several sessions dedicated to setting up and use Dokos.  

The final program of these two days will be constructed based on the registrations and the interest shown for each of the proposed tools.  

All of this will take place in the idyllic surroundings of the third place [l'Hermitage in Autrêches.](https://www.hermitagelelab.com/)

Except Dokos, 9 other software of collaborative platforms will be presented and will be subject to dedicated workshops:


- [France Barter](www.francebarter.coop)  
  Collaborative marketplace on which companies can exchange goods and services. The originality of the platform comes from the fact that invoicing is not done in euro, but in "Barter", a virtual solidary currency with the same face value than euro, but not directly convertible and therefore destined to circulate around members of the network.
- [Les oiseaux de passages](https://lesoiseauxdepassage.coop/)  
  Les oiseaux de passages is a cooperative platform for another kind of travel. It favours direct exchanges and encounters between inhabitants, professionals and travelers, from human to human. It allows local stakeholders to promote their hosting and activities offers, their creations and productions, their good plans and to tell them under the form of stories, itineraries and destinations. Third places are members of these communities or create them by bringing together people around their project. They are supported in to tell and share their destination.

  Open Food is a cooperative network allowing the creation of a point of sale for locally produced farming food. During the containment period, numerous third places have allowed their community to supply themselves through local direct distribution via this solution, with farm drives for example.
