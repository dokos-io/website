# How we protect your privacy on dokos.io and when you use our services

DOKOS SAS offer many services to help you run your business, including a platform to host your own __Dokos__ database. As part of running those services we collect data about you and your business. This data is not only essential to run our services, but also critical for the safety of our services and all our users.

This policy explains what information is collected, why it is collected, and how we use it.

## Information we collect

Most of the personal data we collect is directly provided by our users when they register and use our services. Other data is collected by recording interactions with our services.

**Account & Contact Data:** When you register on our website to subscribe to one of our services (__Dokos__ free trial or hosting service), or fill in one of our contact forms, you voluntarily give us certain information. This typically includes your _name, company name, email address,_ and sometimes your _phone number, postal address_ (when an invoice is required) as well as a _personal password_ to access our online platform.

We <span style="text-decoration: underline;">never record or store credit card information from our customers</span>, and always rely on trusted third-party PCI-DSS-compliant payment processors for credit card processing, including for recurring payment processing.

**Job Application Data:** When you apply for a job on our website or via an employment agency, we usually collect your contact information (_name, email, phone_), and any information you choose to share with us, in your _introduction letter_ and _Curriculum Vitae_. If we decide to send you a job proposition, we will also ask you to provide extra personal details, as required to fulfill our legal obligations and personnel management requirements.

We will **not** ask you to provide information that is not necessary for the recruitment process. In particular, we will **never** collect any information about your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade union membership or sexual life.

**Browser Data:** When you visit our website and access our online services, we detect and store your _browser language and geolocation,_ in order to customize your experience according to your country and preferred language. Our servers also passively record a summary of the information sent by your browser, for statistical, security and legal purposes: your _IP address_, the _time and date of your visit_, your _browser version and platform,_ and the _web page that referred you_ to our website.

**Customer Database:** When you subscribe to one of our services and create your own __Dokos__ database (for example by starting a Free Trial), any information or content you submit or upload into your database is your own, and you control it fully.

This data will often include personal information, for example: _your list of employees, your contacts and customers, your messages, pictures, videos, etc_. We only ever collect this information <span style="text-decoration: underline;">on your behalf</span>, and **you always retain ownership and full control on this data**.

## How we use this information

**Account & Contact Data:** We use your contact information in order to provide our services, to answer your requests, and for billing and account management reasons. We may also use this information for marketing and communication purposes (our marketing messages always come with a way for you to opt-out at any time). We also use this data in aggregated/anonymised form in order to analyze service trends.

**Job Application Data:** We will only process this information for our recruitment process, in order to evaluate and follow-up with your application, and in the course of preparing your contract, if we decide to send you a job proposition. You may contact us at any time to request the deletion of your information.

**Browser Data:** This automatically recorded data is anonymously analyzed in order to maintain and improve our services.

**Customer Database:** We only collect and process this data on your behalf, in order to perform the services you have subscribed to, and based on the instructions you explicitly gave when you registered or configured your service and your database.

Our Helpdesk staff and engineers may access this information in a limited and reasonable manner in order to solve any issue with our services, or at your explicit request for support reasons, or as required by law.

Dokos SAS is therefore considered a **data processor** of the personal data stored in the databases of its customers and the customer is considered the **data controller** of any personal data stored in its database.

## Accessing, Updating or Deleting Your Personal Information

**Account & Contact Data:** You have the right to access and update personal data you have previously provided to us. You can do so at any time by connecting to your personal account on dokos.io. If you wish to permanently delete your account or personal information for a legitimate purpose, please contact "help@dokos.io" to request so. We will take all reasonable steps to permanently delete your personal information, except when we are required to keep it for legal reasons (typically, for administration, billing and tax reporting reasons).

**Job Application Data:** You may contact us at any time to request access, updates or deletion of your application information. The easiest way to do it is to reply to the last message you exchanged with our Human Resource personnel.

**Customer Database:** You can manage any data collected in your databases hosted by DOKOS SAS at any time, using your administration credentials, including modifying or deleting any personal data stored therein.

At any time you can export a complete backup of your database via your hosted software, in order to transfer it, or to manage your own backups/archive. You are responsible for processing this data in compliance with all privacy regulations.

You may also request the deletion of your entire database at any time.

**Safety Retention Period:** we retain a copy of your data in our backups for safety reasons, even after they are destroyed from our live systems. These data will be permanently deleted after the safety retention period. (For more details regarding the safety period, see the terms and conditions of our services and the data retention section below).

## Security

We realize how important and sensitive your personal data is, and we take a great number of measures to ensure that this information is securely processed, stored and preserved from data loss and unauthorized access. Please contact us to know more about our security measures.

## Third Party Service Providers

In order to support our operations we rely on several Service Providers. They help us with various services such as payment processing, web audience analysis, cloud hosting, marketing and communication, etc.

Whenever we share data with these Service Providers, we make sure that they use it in compliance with Data Protection legislation, and that the processing they carry out for us is limited to our specific purpose and covered by a specific data processing contract.

Here is a list of the Service Providers we are currently using, why we use them, and what kind of data we share with them:

|**Service Provider**|**Purpose**|**Share Data**|
|--------------------------|----------|---------------------|

## Data Retention

**Account & Contact Data**: we will only retain such data as long as necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, as laid out in this policy, including any legal retention period, or as long as necessary to carry out a legitimate and reasonable promotion of our products and services.

**Job Application Data:** If we do not hire you, we may keep the information you provide for up to 2 years in order to contact you again for any new job proposition that may come up, unless you ask us not to do so. If we hire you, your personal information will be stored for the duration of your employment contract with us, and afterwards, during the applicable legal retention period that applies in the country where we employed you.

**Browser Data**: we will only retain this data for a short period of time, generally 2 months, unless we need to keep it in relation with a legitimate concern related to the security or performance of our services, or as required by law.

**Customer Database**: we will only retain this data as long as necessary for providing the services you subscribed to. For databases hosted on the Dokos Cloud, if you cancel the service your database is kept deactivated for 4 weeks (the grace period during which you can change your mind), and then destroyed.

**Safety Retention Period:**

We always try to preserve your data from accidental or malicious deletion. As a result, after we delete any of your personal information (Account & Contact Data) from our database upon request from you, or after you delete any personal information from your database (Customer Database), or if you delete your entire database, it is not immediately deleted from our backup systems, which are secured and inalterable. The personal data could remain stored for up to 12 months in those backups, until they are automatically destroyed.

We commit not to use those backup copies of your deleted data for any purpose except for maintaining the integrity of our backups, unless you or the law require us to do so.

## Transfer of Data

**Hosting Locations**: Customer databases are hosted in the Dokos data center in the following countries: France and Germany.

**Backup Locations**: backups are replicated on multiple availability zone in order to meet our Disaster Recovery objectives, and are located in the following countries, regardless of the hosting location: France and Germany

## Third Party Disclosure

Except as explicitly mentioned above, we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal data to third parties.

## Cookie Policy

**Cookies** are small bits of information sent by our servers to your computer or device when you access our services, and unique to you. They are stored in your browser and later sent back to our servers so that we can provide contextual content.

We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.

You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser's Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies, or look at the links below.
