    - label: What is included in the hosting offer ?

      defaultOpen: true
    - label: Why do you charge based on the number of documents created and not per user ?
      content: Our experience shows that your usage of the software, and therefore your hosting needs, do not depend on the number of users. You may want to give access to your accountant or to users with very limited permissions and we understand that you would not want to be fully charged for these types of users.
    - label: What does 1 created document in Dokos represent ?
      content: Every time you create a new customer or a new quotation it counts as a new created document. We do exclude all technical document, such as logs, or incoming emails from the number of created documents. You can see the details of all created document in your customer account.
    - label: Why is there a limit on the number of emails sent from Dokos ?
      content: Our hosting offers do include a pre-configured email integration with our email provider. You can always change the setup to integrate your own email provider with Dokos and avoid this limit.
    - label: What happens if I reach my file storage limit ?
      content: You can keep your current plan rate and we will only propose you an additional file storage extension. Each additional 10GB is charged 5€/month.
    - label: What if my usage goes above my current plan limit ?
      content: Your site will still be available. If your usage is above the limit for several months in a row we will contact you to discuss about your upgrade options.
    - label: Can I switch to a self hosted instance after some time on Dokos Cloud ?
      content: Yes, you can always download all your data (database + files) and migrate them to a self hosted instance. We would be happy to provide you support if needed. You can also switch back to Dokos Cloud anytime.
    - label: Do your offer support ?
      content: Yes, email support is included in the Startup and Premium plans. For lower plans, you can ask any question on the community forum and we will be happy to help you.
    - label: What if I have more questions ?
